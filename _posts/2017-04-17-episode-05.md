### How Mastodon usernames work

As mentioned in the show you can register in any of the 850+ instances. Within each Mastodon instance, usernames just appear as `@username`, similar to Twitter. Users from other instances appear, and can be searched for and followed, as `@user@instancename.ext`.

So for example, my username is `@ajaykarwal` on the mastodon.social instance can be followed from other instances as `@ajaykarwal@mastodon.social`. When you're not logged in, the easiest way to find a user is to rearrange the full username into a url like [https://mastodon.social/@ajaykarwal](https://mastodon.social/@ajaykarwal)

It's a little confusing at first but it makes sense. It's a bit like email. You sign up on a particular email service but you can contact anyone on any email service via their username and domain.
