## Sponsor - Trace by Sticker Mule
This show is sponsored by Sticker Mule, who have a cool new tool to share with the world called Trace.

Trace is a free tool for instantly removing the background from your photos.

Simply upload your photo and the Trace AI and machine learning will recognise the complicated details and cut out the main subject with impressive precision.

After tracing an object, you can download the image with a transparent background, add a new background image or colour, or even use the image to order some Die-cut stickers.

Head over to [stickermule.com/trace](https://stickermule.com/trace) to find out more.
