# Welcome to Inspect - [inspect.fm](http://www.inspect.fm).

Inspect is a show about the world of web development, design and technology hosted by [Ajay Karwal](http://ajaykarwal.com) &mdash; a designer and front-end developer, pixel perfectionist, Apple enthusiast and all round technophile &mdash; with some occasional guests.

The show was started as a way for me to discuss the things I experience in my daily life as a software developer and as an opportunity to speak to some industry friends.
