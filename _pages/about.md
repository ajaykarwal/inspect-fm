Inspect is a show about the world of web development, design and technology hosted by [Ajay Karwal](http://ajaykarwal.com) &mdash; a designer and front-end developer, pixel perfectionist, Apple enthusiast and all round technophile &mdash; with some occasional guests.

Some of the topics I'll be talking about include
- Web Development
- Design
- Software / Tools
- Frameworks
- Apps
- Work Life Balance
- Events
- ...
- Beers and Whisky

The show was started as a way for me to discuss the things I experience in my daily life as a software developer and as an opportunity to speak to some industry friends.
